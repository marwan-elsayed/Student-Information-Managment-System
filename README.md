# Student-Information-Managment-System
##Description
The Student Information Management System is a C-based project developed as part of my Embedded Systems course at Edges For Training, under the mentorship of Mohamed Tarek. This system provides a command-line interface to manage student records efficiently. It supports various operations such as adding, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting student information.

##Features
Add New Student: Input and store student information (ID, name, age, and GPA) in a linked list.
Display Students: Display all student records stored in the system.
Search by ID: Find and display a student’s information using their unique ID.
Update Student Information: Modify a student’s information based on their ID.
Delete Student Record: Remove a student’s data from the system.
Calculate Average GPA: Compute the average GPA of all students.
Identify Top Performer: Find and display the student with the highest GPA.
Exit Program: Safely exit the system.

##How It Works
The system uses a linked list to store student records dynamically. Each student’s data is stored in a node of the linked list, making it easy to add, remove, and update records.
