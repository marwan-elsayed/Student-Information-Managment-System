# Student-Information-Managment-System
## Description

The Student Information Management System is a C-based project developed as part of my Embedded Systems course at Edges For Training, under the mentorship of Mohamed Tarek. This system provides a command-line interface to manage student records efficiently. It supports various operations such as adding, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting student information.

## Features

1- Add New Student: Input and store student information (ID, name, age, and GPA) in a linked list.

2- Display Students: Display all student records stored in the system.

3- Search by ID: Find and display a student’s information using their unique ID.

4- Update Student Information: Modify a student’s information based on their ID.

5- Delete Student Record: Remove a student’s data from the system.

6- Calculate Average GPA: Compute the average GPA of all students.

7- Identify Top Performer: Find and display the student with the highest GPA.

8- Exit Program: Safely exit the system.

## How It Works

The system uses a linked list to store student records dynamically. Each student’s data is stored in a node of the linked list, making it easy to add, remove, and update records.
